const description = "This playlist evokes the minimalist and meditative qualities of 'Koyaanisqatsi' by Philip Glass. It features compositions that blend repetition, atmosphere, and subtle emotional shifts, offering a reflective and cinematic journey through time and sound.";

list of why each song was chosen:

1. **Music for 18 Musicians: Section II - Steve Reich**  
   - Chosen for its minimalist structure and rhythmic pulsations, this piece aligns with the repetitive, evolving motifs found in Glass's work, particularly in "Koyaanisqatsi."
   
2. **Struggle for Pleasure - Wim Mertens**  
   - Mertens' piano-driven composition offers a similar meditative and expansive feeling, perfect for those who appreciate the emotional subtleties in Glass’s music.

3. **Metamorphosis I - Erik Satie (Reimagined by Penguin Cafe)**  
   - Satie’s original simplicity, reinterpreted by Penguin Cafe, provides a minimalist reworking that mirrors the hypnotic repetition and evolving textures of Glass's work.

4. **Emerald and Stone - Brian Eno**  
   - Eno's ambient compositions introduce a sense of space and reflection, echoing the environmental and existential themes present in "Koyaanisqatsi."

5. **Opus 23 - Dustin O'Halloran**  
   - This modern piece, with its flowing piano and gentle crescendos, evokes the emotional build and meditative calmness that Glass's minimalism is known for.

6. **The Poet Acts - Michael Nyman**  
   - Nyman’s collaboration with filmmakers shares a cinematic quality similar to Glass’s, making this hauntingly beautiful piano piece a fitting inclusion.

7. **Glassworks: Opening - Lavinia Meijer**  
   - Meijer’s harp rendition of Glass’s "Glassworks" perfectly encapsulates his minimalist style while adding a new texture through the harp, making it a natural companion to "Koyaanisqatsi."

8. **A Model of the Universe - Jóhann Jóhannsson**  
   - Jóhannsson’s ability to blend electronics with orchestration results in a timeless, meditative piece that resonates with the same tension and release found in "Koyaanisqatsi."

9. **Knee Play 1 - Philip Glass Ensemble (From Einstein on the Beach)**  
   - While still by Glass, this lesser-known work from "Einstein on the Beach" uses the same kind of hypnotic vocal and instrumental patterns found in "Koyaanisqatsi."

10. **Movement 3 - Max Richter**  
    - Richter’s combination of strings and electronics evokes a haunting, minimalist atmosphere that resonates with Glass's sense of time and space.
